#This host inventory file, is logically separated by 'group'. Each group, should be separated by authentication/credential type. Example: Any hosts that are known to authenticate with local quanta credentials, should be placed in the inventory section for [quanta_local]. Likewise, hosts known to authenticate with a particular LDAP, should be placed in their respective inventory section.
